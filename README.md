# Python JupyterLab Buildpack

The `python-jupyterlab-buildpack` is a [Cloud Foundry][] buildpack which uses [Continuum's conda][] for package management.


## Usage
To use this buildpack specify the URI of the repository when pushing a Python web application to Cloud Foundry.

    cf push -b https://github.com/kdunn-pivotal/python-jupyterlab-buildpack.git


## Python Dependencies
This buildpack uses conda environments to make it easy to replicate dependicies from a development environment.
See the [conda documentation](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/env-commands.html) for more details.

If you are using a conda environment locally you can export the packages currently installed into a file
named `environment.yml`:

    conda env export -f environment.yml

The name of the environment is not important and will be overridden during installation.

Alternatively if an `environment.yml` file is not present, the buildpack supports dependencies declaration using a `requirements.txt` file  for `pip` packages and a `conda_requirements.txt` file for conda packages.

These files should be located in the root of the directory being pushed to Cloud Foundry. The buildpack will first use `conda` to install those requirements, then use pip.
